# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

## ADR 1: Choice of Framework
**Date:** 2023-10-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** We needed a robust framework to build a scalable fintech backend platform.  
**Decision:** We chose NestJS as the backend framework due to its modular architecture, TypeScript support, and built-in features for building RESTful APIs.  
**Consequences:** This decision allows for better maintainability and scalability of the application.

## ADR 2: Database Selection
**Date:** 2023-10-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The application requires a primary database for transactional data and a secondary database for logging and analytics.  
**Decision:** We selected MySQL as the primary database for its ACID compliance and reliability, and MongoDB as the secondary database for its flexibility in handling unstructured data.  
**Consequences:** This choice enables efficient transaction handling while allowing for extensive logging and analytics capabilities.

## ADR 3: Authentication Method
**Date:** 2023-10-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The application requires secure user authentication.  
**Decision:** We implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication due to its stateless nature and ease of use in a RESTful API context.  
**Consequences:** This decision simplifies the authentication process and enhances security by avoiding session management on the server.

## ADR 4: Validation Library
**Date:** 2023-10-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Input validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security.  
**Decision:** We chose class-validator for its seamless integration with TypeScript and NestJS, allowing for easy validation of user input.  
**Consequences:** This choice improves the reliability of the application by ensuring that only valid data is processed.

## ADR 5: Error Handling Strategy
**Date:** 2023-10-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Comprehensive error handling is necessary for a financial application to ensure user trust and data integrity.  
**Decision:** We implemented a centralized error handling middleware to manage errors consistently across the application.  
**Consequences:** This approach enhances the user experience by providing clear error messages and logging errors for further analysis.

## ADR 6: Logging Strategy
**Date:** 2023-10-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Logging is essential for monitoring application performance and troubleshooting issues.  
**Decision:** We chose to implement a custom logger utility that logs application events and errors to a file and/or external logging service.  
**Consequences:** This decision allows for better monitoring and debugging of the application, which is critical in a fintech environment.
